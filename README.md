# Spring Boot Country API

A REST API built using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL that serves information about countries, their cities, and the languages spoken in those countries. The data is retrieved from a local MySQL database with a predefined schema (`world`).

## Features

- Fetch country details along with associated cities and languages in a single JSON response.
- MySQL database integration with JPA for efficient querying and relationship mapping.
- Organized and scalable code structure using Spring Boot and MVC architecture.

## Schema Overview

The project uses the following database tables from the `world` schema:

### Table: `country`

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dstroke-afk/spring-boot-country-api.git
   cd spring-boot-country-api
2. Configure the Database:

Create a MySQL database named world.
Import the schema with the world database structure.

3. Update Application Properties: Update src/main/resources/application.properties with your MySQL credentials:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/world
spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password

4. Run the Application:

Build and run the application using Maven or your IDE:

./mvnw spring-boot:run

5. Access the API:

Visit http://localhost:8080/api/countries to fetch country data.

6. API Response Example
Sample JSON response for a single country:

{
  "code": "USA",
  "name": "United States",
  "continent": "North America",
  "region": "Northern America",
  "population": 331002651,
  "cities": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "New York",
      "district": "New York",
      "population": 8175133
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Los Angeles",
      "district": "California",
      "population": 3792621
    }
  ],
  "languages": [
    {
      "language": "English",
      "isOfficial": "T",
      "percentage": 79.0
    },
    {
      "language": "Spanish",
      "isOfficial": "F",
      "percentage": 13.0
    }
  ]
}

7. Technologies Used
Java: Programming language.
Spring Boot: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
MySQL: Relational database for storing country, city, and language data.
Spring Data JPA: ORM for database interaction.

8. Future Enhancements
Add pagination and filtering for API responses.
